## Final response (truncated)

```
GREEN. All 3 tests pass.

---

The 3 hours of implementation knowledge aren't lost — `subtract` ended up identical. What changed is that the tests now *mean* something: they were written when `subtract` didn't exist and failed for the right reason. Tests written after passing code can't fail, so they verify nothing.

Dinner is still on time.
